        <br>
                <p>In the 1831 Alexis de Tocqueville, a French citizen born to an aristocratic family, travelled to America to study the penal system.  Tocqueville, however, was interested in understanding democracy, and in 1835 published Democracy in America.  He made many keen observations of America as he tried to understand how liberty was maintained in the absence of the types of hierarchies present in monarchies.  He found that Americans held the “knowledge of how to combine”, and had an active citizenry that formed all manner of membership associations – unions, churches, social groups, reform crusades, with shared goals and aspirations.
                </p>
                <p>In 2000, Harvard scholars Theda Skocpol, Marhall Ganz, and Ziad Munson published a study examining the origins and structures of these early membership organizations, in part to counter the popular narrative of the time that America’s rich history of volunteerism was founded in small, hyper-local, spontaneous forming associations.  In fact, what their research shows is that large, sustaining, membership associations were generally formed from the outset with a national scope and a representative structure that mirrored the American form of government, with members electing representatives as the local, state or regional, and national levels.
